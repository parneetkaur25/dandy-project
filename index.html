    <h2>The Dandy Lineup</h2>
    <p>
    The full Dandy line up of beers. Made in small batches, available province-wide.
    </p>
    <h3>Dandy in the Underworld (5.5% ABV)</h3>
    <p>
        The main Dandy. This beer is our most popular offering and available everywhere, all the time. A light body with notes of coffee, chocolate, and light roast. This traditional Oyster Stout is sure to be a favourite.<br>Pairs well with oysters, fish, and other salty snacks!
    </p>
    <h3>Une Vieille Maitresse (4.5% ABV)</h3>
    <p>
        This farmhouse ale is available year round in the bottle and draught. A table strength beer brewed with rye and french saison yeast. It is light, refreshing, with a touch of spice and saison character. Brewed once as a limited edition, we can't seem to shake this old mistress.
    </p>
    <h3>The Dandy Wild Sour Ale (7.3% ABV)</h3>
    <p>
        A bold, malty sour ale soured with lactobacillus and fermented with a wild yeast strain. An upfront sourness is balanced with wild yeast character for a rich sour experience.
    </p>
    <h3>The Golden Brown Dandy (6% ABV)</h3>
    <p>
        Our English Pale ale. This beer is a low-carbonation ode to real-ale. A smooth malt body is balanced with a highly intensive hops schedule to bring forward a great tasting beer to reward all ale lovers! Available only in bottles and casks.<br>Pairs well with meats, rich sauces and hard, aged  cheeses
    </p>
 
    <h2>Seasonal Releases</h2>
    <p>Four exciting beers a year with wide release. Look for them when the weather begins to turn.</p>
    <h3>Fall: Baltus van Tassel: Cherry Sour (7% ABV)</h3>
    <p>An American Style Cherry Sour.  A rich brown American Brown sour brewed with Sweet and Tart cherries for the perfect accompaniment to shorter days and colder weather.</p>
    <h3>Winter: In the Bleak Midwinter: Black IPA (6.5% ABV)</h3>
    <p>A fruity Black IPA. With only a kiss of roast, this black IPA is fresh and juicy but dark as the coldest days of winter. Citra and Mosaic are late hop additions to avoid the bitterness and focus on aroma.</p>
    <h3>Spring: The Jungle Bird: Tropical Dark Sour (5% ABV)</h3>
    <p>An homage to the classic Tiki cocktail.This beer has notes of demerara sugar, bitter lime, tropical pineapple coming together for a refreshing sour that is like no other.</p>
    <h3>Summer: Bright Young Things: Hopped Wheat Ale (5.5% ABV)</h3>
    <p>English Summer Ale. A style developed during a late 70’s heat wave in England, this beer is designed to refresh in the hot summer sun. Dry, with a touch of wheat and toasted Victory malt, it is balanced with a touch of bitterness and a sweet citrus aroma. Patios, BBQ’s, and friends all pair perfectly with this beer!</p>

    <h3>Our Story: Chef. Chemist. Teacher. Business</h3>
    <p>The story goes back. Two high-school classmates begin a business, they graduated and went their separate ways. They cross paths again years later to discuss an interest, and a passion.</p>
    <p>In the fall of 2013, the Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission made sweeping changes to the brewing industry in Alberta, allowing small craft breweries to exist. It came at a perfect time. For years Ben Leon, a teacher, and Dylan Nosal, a chef, had been growing their home-brew experience, not only in size but also in knowledge. Over the course of a few years of practice, learning, and many batches, they began brewing exceptional beers on a home-built 1BBL brewhouse.</p>
    <p>While honing skills, the two were developing a keen taste for the growing selection of Craft beer flooding into Alberta. Much of their guidance came from Matt Gaetz, a veteran of the liquor business in Alberta, and a close friend. Between the three of them, the topic of starting something amazing often came up over beers and brewing. They knew they wanted it, they just weren't sure it was possible under old laws. Changes in law meant it was possible.</p>
    <p>Discussion after discussion, batch after batch, ideas developed into plans. What it always boiled down to was that the brewery would have to be exciting, forward thinking, and outside the traditional thought box for breweries in the province. Exciting beer styles, quality ingredients, and attention to every detail of production.</p>
    <p>Cue the return of Derek Waghray, a high-school friend studying chemistry on the West coast. On his return to Calgary, and with a new-found interest in brewing and craft beer, he got in touch with an old high school friend. A home brew batch later, and a discussion of wild dreams, he was added to the group. He was a much needed addition bringing expertise in laboratory process and a deep understanding of the science behind the beer.</p>
    <p>When the laws were officially changed in December 2013, the four Dandies moved quickly to hammer out the final details for The Dandy Brewing Company.</p>
    <p>In January 2014 the Dandy Brewing Company was incorporated. April 2014 the lease was signed. June 2014 the brewhouse was built. August 2014 the brewing began. September 2014 the beer hit the shelves. April 2015 the first draught accounts started pouring. November 2015 the Tap Room opened. January 2016 a three-fold expansion of capacity was completed.</p>
    <p>April 2018 saw the opening of the The Dandy Brewing Company and Tasting Room, a new production facility and full service tasting room located in the heart of Ramsay, Calgary. Fine Dining drinking food. Dandy beers. Cocktails. wine. The full Dandy experience.</p>
